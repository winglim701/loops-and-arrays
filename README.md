# loops and arrays Project
## Basic Java Project

For the last part, I want you to continue to practice Loops. You should do the following within a project named loops-and-arrays and in a class such as MoreLoopingApp. Create a separate method for each of the exercises below:

Create a Loop  for each of the following 4 outputs:

* 10,9,8,7,6,5
* [0][1][2][3][4][5]
* 1000<<<200<<<40<<<8
* {{{{-9999{{{{-3333{{{{-1111

Create 2 loops, one within another to print the which the following:

******
***** 
****
***
**
*

Create 3 loops, one within another to print the which the following:

      *
     **
    ***
   ****
  *****
 ******

Create a loop which keeps asking "What do you want to do?", echoing the activity back to user, until the user types "exit":
*(Note to compare String values YOU CANNOT USE ==, you must use equals or equalsIgnoreCase() MORE_INFO_HERE
     

*Java 8*

* Maven
* Log4j
* TestNG
